  Warning: Due to the security fix, all login sessions will be logged out, after updated to this version.
  
  Important: If you are using some unofficial/3rd party tools, it could be a breaking change. You may need to re-generate an auth token.
  
  üêõ Bug Fixes:
  
  - Fixed an issue that notification is not working if the config is too long
  
  - Enable status page certificate expiry badge for all HTTP(s) monitors

  - Fixed kafka producer bugs

  - Fixed an issue that x-forwarded-host is not being used correctly

  - Fixed a race condition issue that some data is not being saved in the status page editor if you clicked it too fast


  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Security Fixes

  - Fixed persistent session tokens issue. There was no way to revoke session tokens even if you changed the password. Now you can revoke them by changing your password if you think they may be leaked (Read more: GHSA-g9v2-wqcj-j99g).
