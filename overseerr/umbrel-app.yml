  Overseerr is a request management and media discovery tool built to work with your existing Plex ecosystem.


  Overseerr scans your Plex libraries at regular intervals, so it knows which items are already available on your server.
  It also integrates with the popular DVR applications Radarr and Sonarr, and supports activity monitoring within Overseerr itself.


  🛠️ SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS

  During initial set-up, you will need to input your Umbrel device's IP address to connect to Plex (and optional services such as Radarr and Sonarr).
  You can find your device's IP address by visiting your router's admin dashboard or by using an IP scanning tool like Angry IP Scanner.

releaseNotes: >-
  This update of Overseerr from version 1.32.5 to 1.33.2 includes various bug fixes, improvements, and new features, including the following highlights.

  New:

    - Availability Sync: This long-awaited feature is finally here. Overseerr will now synchronize the media availability state with your Plex and Radarr/Sonnar instances.

  Fixed:

    - Removed the ability to customize the watchlist sync job schedule
    - You can now add a streaming service custom slider to your discover page.
    - You can now enable user tagging for your Radarr/Sonarr instances. 
    - You can now filter on browse pages by TMDB user vote count. Combining this with TMDB score can give you much better results.]
    - Download statuses will automatically auto-refresh on title cards when they are in progress.
    - If you have users with over 1000 requests, they can now be deleted if you choose to do so.
    - Resolved issue with create slider causing incorrect form submission
    - Handle issue causing incorrect media to change to unknown
