description: >-
  RoboSats is a simple and private app to exchange bitcoin for national currencies. 
  Robosats simplifies the P2P user experience and uses lightning hold invoices to 
  minimize custody and trust requirements. The deterministically generated robot 
  avatars help users stick to best privacy practices.


  Features:


  - Privacy focused: your robot avatar is deterministically generated, no need for registration.

  - More than 10 languages available and over 60 fiat currencies

  - Safe: simply lock a lightning hodl invoice and show you are real and committed.

  - No data collection. Your communication with your peer is PGP encrypted, only you can read it.

  - Lightning fast: the average sovereign trade finishes in ~ 8 minutes. Faster than a single block confirmation!

  - Fully collateralized escrow: your peer is always committed and cannot run away with the funds.

  - Strong incentives system: attempts of cheating are penalized with the slashing of the Sats in the fidelity bond.

  - Guides and video tutorials available at https://learn.robosats.com/watch/en

releaseNotes: >-
  We have introduced a new feature, F2F (Face-to-Face), allowing users to add a location for face-to-face cash trades. 
  The book page now displays a map with all F2F orders. For privacy reasons, the exact location of your order is slightly randomized (uniform random 15 x 15 Km noise) when you click on the map to locate it. 
  This means it's not possible to be precise, and the exact location can only be shared on the encrypted chat. 
  Please note that using high-resolution maps can leak your IP to external tiling servers if you are not using Tor Browser.


  Of course, adding a geolocation tag to your order is only a good idea if you want to use face-to-face cash as a payment method. 
  You can completely disregard this feature if you do not want to use this payment method.


  Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements:

  - Dependency updates.

  - Small bug fixes.

  - Improved DB Writes performance related to last_login user field.

  - Fix small bug on order logging that made automatic dispute resolutions fail.

  - Devfund Donation Pubkey has been updated to RoboSats experimental LND2 node.
